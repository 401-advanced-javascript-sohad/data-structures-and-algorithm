# Singly Linked List
- Short brief how it's work and linked to each other as a object chain 

## Challenge
- Utilize any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge.

# Linked List Insertions
These methods insert new node into the array, either before or after a target node.

## Approach & Efficiency
These use while loops to traverse the list.  The worst case would be to traverse the whole length of the array, so the time would be O(n).


## API
- insertAfter : Insert node after given value 
- insert : Create new Node and add it at first
- to string : convert all list items to string 
- includes : find certain node 
- Append : add new node to the end of the list
- insertBefore : Insert Node before another Node
