# Singly Linked List - Data Structures Lab
Using methods learned in class and in readings, create a linked list and corresponding functionality

## Challenge

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.


- using LinkedList class, include  head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.


- Define insert method which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

- Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.



## Approach & Efficiency

 I went through each item in the challenge and coded it, console logging along the way to ensure things were working as expected. I then spent time writing tests for each method, and updated my original code as needed based on my test assertions.

I believe this code has an O(1) time performance

## API
- `insert(value)` allows you to add a new item to the linked list
- `includes(value)` allows you to discover if an item exists in the linked list
- `print()` allows you to see each item included in the linked list



## Challenge
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

- `.append(value)` which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
- `.insertBefore(value, newVal)` which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
- `.insertAfter(value, newVal)` which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
- You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class.

## Approach & Efficiency

-i coded things up, had a number of problems
- Once my methods were working we wrote our tests!
