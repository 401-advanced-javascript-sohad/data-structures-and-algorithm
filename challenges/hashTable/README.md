# Challenge Summary


## Challenge Description

### Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:
1. `add`: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.

2. `get`: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.

3. `contains`: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

4. `hash`: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency

_Adding a key oR value to your hashtable results in the value being in the data structure, Retrieving based on a key returns the value stored, Successfully returns null for a key that does not exist in the hashtable Successfully handle a collision within the hashtable_
